A compilation of my notes, articles, and projects.

## Built With...
All posts are written in Markdown which are compiled into HTML via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Both Jekyll's execution and the hosting of the site's files are handled by [Github pages](https://pages.github.com). The site's theme is a modified version of [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
