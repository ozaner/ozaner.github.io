$T:V\to W\quad \mathcal N(T)\subset V\quad R(T)\subset W$

null space includes 0 since all LT take 0 to 0. Closed under addition because if $v,w\in N$ then $T(v)+T(w)=0\implies T(v+w)=0$

## ch 5
a vector space V of dim n is isomorphic to F^n where F is V's underlying feild. We can thus study linear maps T:V to W by studying matrices from F^n to F^m. O_b^-1(v) takes F^n to V, and O_b' takes W to F^m. ALso note that the space of lienar transformation from V to W is isomorphic to the space from F^n to F^m. THen we compose [T]^b'_b=O_b circ T circ O_b^-1.

matrix representative of lienar map T w.r.t to basis b and b'

for the matrix representatives, map composition gives the same matrix multilpication (basis b' should be the same) and addition is same and so is scalar multiplication.
