Question 1

How do we learn about animal minds? How does it differ from how we study human cognition? How are the challenges similar?

Unlike human subjects, animals cannot usually tell experimenters about their mental representations (if they have any). To learn make conclusions about these purported mental experiences then, we find behaviors that are similar to our own that we may associate with a particular emotion or mental state (e.g. bashing hands on the ground seems to denote anger).

This however has major flaws, the primary one being the assumption that our mental experiences are similar enough, or even comparable, to that of another animal's. It is common for humans to anthropomorphize animals in this way without even thinking about it as it is second nature for us to understand things in terms of *human* emotions.

The resolution to this is to simply seek functional differences in the behaviors of different species when comparing their cognition. Notice that this is a very similar line of reasoning to that of the functionalism camp in psychology. Functionalists argued that behavior could only truly be measured and reasoned about scientifically by observing the behaviors of humans rather than their mental states or what they were 'thinking'.

This highlights the fact that comparative cognition faces similar challenges to that of the study of human cognition. Scientists may be skeptical in how much can they trust a human test subject's testimony especially knowing how inaccurate they can be (filling in gaps).

This leaves only behavior, and the difficulties in standardizing experiments to measure it, which is something common to both animal and human subjects.

For example, tests that measure how fair humans are (like the ultimatum game [Proctor, et. al.]) are very similar to the versions used on monkey test subjects. Neither of them rely on any notion of reported mental states but instead measure behavior and ascribe the descriptor of 'fairness' to the results (more equitable choices are 'fair')
