## Behavioral Economics
Behavioral economics studies the different economic decisions an agent may make while also considering their cognition, emotions, incentives, psychology, as well as cultural and social factors.

This is opposed to the standard economic analysis of decisions that takes a more pure game theoretic standpoint where each agent is perfectly rational and selfish and thus will always make the decision that will leave them with highest end utility.

### Why not Classical Economics?
While the standard approach to economics can be enlightening (especially in studying things like incentives), it does not translate well to a world of irrational humans who cannot always arrive at the most rational option (that is they have a **bounded rationality**) or who may even actively choose an irrational option based on their current mental and emotional state.

### An Example: The Ultimatum Game
The ultimatum game, which with some modification can apply to real world scenarios like salary negotiations, illustrates the need for behavioral economics.

Given the rules of the ultimatum game, that is the proposer proposes some distribution of the 'pie' to be shared between them and the responder, the most rational choice for the proposer is to allocate the smallest non-zero amount to the responder. In turn, the best choice for the responder given this situation is to accept as the choice is simply a very little amount of money vs. no money.

Empirical evidence, however, refutes this view. Indeed, in the real world responders often reject offers that appear to be inequitable to them despite it being irrational from a game theoretic perspective.

As a result we have to extend the scope of the reasoning we allow for these behaviors. In this case we use the fact that humans dislike being taken advantage of and that they will actively spite those who dare attempt this, regardless of their own outcome.

### Value in Behavioral Economics
By studying where and when humans make these irrational decisions, we can exploit the behaviors that cause them by modifying the environment or language we use in trying to have them make a decisions. An example of this might be the observation that males seem more generous when the fusiform face region of their brain is active, and so by introducing even the most minimal of 'faces' to the environment they make the decision in, we can bias them towards certain outcomes.

This also has broader uses in understanding the decision making process of humans and their underlying social psychology.
