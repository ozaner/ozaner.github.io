## Infant-Directed Speech (IDS)
IDS, or *motherese*, is the characteristic mode of speech an older person uses when conversing with an infant. That is, when talking to a baby, adults tend to use exaggerated syllables and wider ranges of pitches. They also use smaller words and attempt to sound inviting or affectionate.

### Culturally Universal
Interestingly, this behavior of baby talk is present in almost all human cultures. Indeed, most people do not actively attempt to use different intonations and exaggerated speech when talking to babies. Instead, they unconsciously slip into this voice when playing with infants.

### Reflective of Evolution
The fact that this is so universal points towards this behavior being evolved into us for a certain reason. This is unsurprising, as it is not far-fetched to imagine that this exaggerated mode of speech aids in the learning of language by infants. If this is the case then our tendency to talk like this around babies is similar to any other protective instinct we may have for our young.

### Nature vs. Nurture
While this may give credence to idea that parents teach their children language. IDS is not nearly enough to account for the sheer propensity children have for language. Indeed some innate aptitude for it must also be at play.
