## Universal Grammar
Universal grammar (UG) is the theory that  humans are born with certain cognitive faculties that facilitate the learning of language. The theory as a whole was first posited by Noam Chomsky.

To be more specific, Chomsky believes that humans have an innate set of structural rules that languages must follow, and know this regardless of whether they have learned or have been exposed to any languages prior.

### Established Grammar
The specific grammar a child, hopefully, learns as they are subject to more language stimulus conforms to these universal principles of natural human language. The stimulus they receive will narrow the space of possible grammars allowed by the UG until they learn the target grammar.

### Poverty of Stimulus
Even further, the reason children are able to learn language so quickly (and even at all in reasonable amount of time) must be due to innate processes. There simply isn't enough stimulus given to a child in the amount of time they need to master a language to narrow their space of potential grammars to the desired one. Without an innate UG, there are too many possible grammars.

#### Evidence for UG
This statement is backed up by the fact that children universally (for the most part) make certain classes of generalization errors and not others. Since these generalization errors are consistent among all languages, it stands to reason it is a feature common to all humans.

UG is further supported by the existence of creole languages which originate from the children of different societies that have abruptly merged. Crucially, the adults of such societies do not speak a coherent creolen language but instead speak a mishmash of the previous languages called pidgin. It is their children that generalize the languages into a single cohesive creolen language that supports UG.
