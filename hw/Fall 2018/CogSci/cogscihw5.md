## The Cross-Activation Hypothesis
The Cross-activation theory is proposed neural basis of synesthesia. The theory goes that the coupling of senses is a result of the close proximity of the parts of the brain responsible for those senses.

The key example of this is the closeness of parts for the brain responsible for the perception color (such as V4 in green above) and parts of the brain responsible for the perception of letters (in red above).

The fact that synesthesia regarding color and letters is extremely common gives credence to this idea. But we are still missing the mechanism by which this cross-activation takes place.

This is believed to be a result of *defective pruning*. The idea is that while the brain is naturally pruned of superfluous or unnecessary neural connections, some people may posses genetic mutations that inhibit this pruning. This might lead to connections being formed between these two proximal areas of the brain that would not exist in 'normal' patients.

An example of this can be found in phantom limb patients. The somatosensory area of the cortex responsible for our arms is adjacent to the one responsible for our face. Cross-activation between these two areas would explain why many patients feel sensation in their now nonexistent limb when their face is touched.
