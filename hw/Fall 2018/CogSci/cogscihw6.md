## The Sally-Anne Test
The false belief test, or **Sally-Anne test**, is a test usually performed on young children and children with mental disabilities.

#### The Procedure
In the test, two dolls named Sally and Anne are introduced to the subject. They perfor a series of actions:

- Sally is shown to put a marble in a basket and then leave the stage all whilst Anne watches.
- Once alone, Anne moves the marble form the basket to a nearby box. (note that it is only possible to tell where the marble is by looking either in the box or basket).
- Sally now returns to look for her marble.

It is at this point that the tester asks the subject a question: "Where will Sally look for the marble?".

#### Why
The answer to this question tells us a lot about the subject's ability to 'mindread' others' thoughts. It is usually the case that children ages 3 and below answer "the box" while children ages 4 and above answer "the box".

What differentiates these two groups, it is thought, is the ability to recognize that distinct people have distinct knowledge/beliefs/ideas and thus different conceptions of the truth. In the 3 year old case the children, now armed with the truth of the marble being in the box, would themselves check the box as they know where the marble is. They assume Sally would do the same as they cannot conceive that she wouldn't know to despite not being present during the switch. The 4 year olds, however, can do just that, telling us they are able to ascribe different beliefs onto others that they themselves may not hold.

#### Autism
Experiments have shown that autistic children are more likely to fail the test even if they are older. They fail the test so consistently that it is commonly used as a marker of autism in children past the age of around 4.

The fact that autistic subjects fail the test more so than not just 'normal' subjects but also patients with down-syndrome, tells us something about the nature of autism beyond just being a cognitive impairment. It would seem that autistic children do not understand or have a theory of mind for other people around them, similar to how 3 year olds might think.
