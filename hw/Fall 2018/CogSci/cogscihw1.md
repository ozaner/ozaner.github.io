## Dualism & The Mind-Body Problem
**Dualists** hold that there exists two types of 'substance'. The mental and physical. How these two substances interact, if they do at all, is the dualist form of the **mind-body problem**.

#### Classical Dualism
This is the prototypical 'flavor' of dualism and originated in early 1600s with Ren√© Descartes. In essence, Descartes believed there existed two types of matter: *res cogitans* (matter of the mind) and *res extensa* (physical matter), and that the former influenced or controlled the latter. He thought this might be realized by the pineal gland in the brain.

That said, classical dualists don't necessarily have to believe in Descartes' conception of classical dualism. Indeed, the key factor that makes this flavor of dualism unique is that in it the physical body is being controlled by some mind separate the brain and *not* the other way around (as opposed to say, interactionism).

$$Mind\rightarrow Body$$

#### Parallelism
Like any other dualist, parallelists hold that there exists both a mind and body seperate from each other. The difference being that they don't believe that these two things can interact with each other in any way.

Then why would these two things be in sync (that is the brain has some measurable consequences when the mind is in a certain state)? A common retort a parallelist might give is that God, or some other force, set both minds and bodies (matter) in motion such that they would be separate but correlated.

$$Mind\not\leftrightarrow Body$$

#### Epiphenomenalism
Epiphenomenalism holds that the causes of all behaviors are purely physical. The mental states a human has are simply emergent products of those physical processes. In this view then, if the human mind were *not* present, there would be no measurable difference in one's behavior as the mind cannot interact with the physical in any way.

This view is an interesting one in that it takes the mind to be a secondary property of the physical and posits a universe where all causes and effects are indeed physical.

$$Body\rightarrow Mind$$

#### Interactionism
Interactionism allows for *both* the mental and physical to interact with each other. The cause of a thought could arise because of some physical phenomenon (a physiological response to being hungry) or some mental phenomenon ("his food looks good, I want some too").

This view is a very intuitive one in the sense that things explained by the physical are chalked up to the physical, and things that can't be explained by the physical are chalked up to the mind.

$$Mind\leftrightarrow Body$$
