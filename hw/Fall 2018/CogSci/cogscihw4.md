### What are Illusory Contours
An illusory contour is a visual illusion where the viewer perceives an edge around what would be a closed shape when in fact there no visible edge present. One example from Wolfe, et al. (Ch. 5) is the following:

Here the illusory contour is the circle of white space *traced* out by the lines normal to it. Note that the contours become more or less pronounced depending on the amount of lines emanating form it. With no lines making no contour and infinite lines tracing out an actual edge.

The existence of these illusory contours tells us about the importance of our middle vision. The middle vision takes in the data from the lower levels of vision and sets up the data for higher level vision. It does this by finding edges and groups that can be processed higher up. The importance of edge detection is highlighted by our, at least in this case, overfitting of our input towards edges. There is no edge around the circle, yet we perceive one and even further our higher level vision can recognize it.
Another interesting consequence of these illusory contours is that our vision must not only rely on actual edges for edge detection but other factors that accompany edges. As an example, consider the following image:

We perceive not one illusory contour but two, and at different depths too. It is common to look at this image and imagine a white triangle resting on top of 3 circles all of which are obscuring another triangle that is composed of 3 obscured borders. As we can see, our detection of edges in this case, while false, relied on the figures around them and their apparent 'incompleteness'.
