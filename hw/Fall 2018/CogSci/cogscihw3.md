### Front
These are the key parts of the eye that make focusing light into the retina possible.

**Pupil**: The hole in the middle of the eye that passes light through the eye into the lens; the space left empty by the iris.

**Iris**: A muscle that contracts the pupil via the ciliary body (another muscle); the colored part of the eye.

**Ciliary Body**: The muscle below the iris that contracts/expands it based on the current light levels. This is the *pupillary light reflex*.

**Lens**: This is where light passes through first after it travels through the pupil. The lens focuses the light into the retina and can as just its focus so that we can make out objects at variable distances.

**Aqueous Humor (body)**: An oxygenated fluid that fills the space behind the cornea; removes waste from and provides nutrients to the cornea and lens.

### Layers
These are the layers of tissue that surround and make up the eyeball.

**Sclera**: The outer, elastic, protective layer of the eye; the white of the eyes.

**Choroid**: Vascular (blood vessels) coat between sclera and retina.

**Retina**: The inner most layer of the eye. Contains the fovea

**Vitreous Humor (body)**: A liquid that fills the empty space (vitreous chamber) in between the retina. This is most of the eyeball.

### Photoreceptor Cells
These cells, located on the retina, are where the transduction from visible light to neural signals takes place.

**Cones**: These cells are dense in the center of our vision. They are best suited to distinguish color.

**Rods**: Complementary to cones, these cells are best suited to detecting light intensity. The are most dense in our peripheral vision.

**Bipolar and Ganglion Cells**: Cells that connect photoreceptors to optic nerve.

$$\text{Photoreceptors} \rightarrow \text{Bipolar} \rightarrow \text{Ganglion} \rightarrow \text{Optic Nerve}$$

**Macula**: A yellow spot at the back center of the retina that is particularly dense with receptors.

**Fovea**: In the middle of the macula. Contains the highest concentration of cone cells. This is because being in the middle of the macula, and by extension the retina, means that the most important light (i.e. from the center of our visual field) reaches this point. So it is here that our eyes have the most visual acuity since there are so many receptors.

## Neural Pathways of Visual Information
Once the visible light from the outside world has been transduced into neural signals, these signals travel through the optic nerve via different pathways to different prats of the brain in order to be processed.

**Left & Right Visual Field**: An area immediately in front of you (the left or right side) that is being projected onto your retina via the lens. At any moment in time this field is a 2d projection of the 3d world.

**Optic Nerve**: A main line that connects the receptors that line the retina to the occipital lobe of the brain for processing. The fact that this large bundle of nerve is in the middle of the retina means that we have a blind spot in our vision.

**Nasal Branch**: The branches of the optic nerve that travel to the opposite side of the brain than where it originated (the right half of the left eye to the right hemisphere and the left half of the right eye to the left hemisphere).

**Temporal Branch**: The branches of the optic nerve that travel to the same side of the brain than where it originated (the left half of the left eye to the left hemisphere and the right half of the right eye to the right hemisphere).

**Optic Chiasma**: The junction where the temporal and nasal branches crossover.

**Geniculostriate Pathway**: From eyes to the LGN (in the thalamus) and relays signals to occipital lobe. Is involved with pattern and color perception.

**Tectopulvinar Pathway**: From eyes to the superior colliculus (also in the thalamus) and relays signals to the temporal and parietal lobes. More involved in light detection and spatial orientation.
