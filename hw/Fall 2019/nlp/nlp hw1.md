cupcake

Both cup and cake are subwords.

unhappiness

The two morphemes that are not words are:

a) "un-" meaning not, reversed, or just simply negating the word.
b) "-ness" being used to turn adjectives or participles (i.e. happy) into nouns (i.e. happiness).

An idiom, like "kick the bucket", is a linguistic pattern that means to die or decease.

This pattern is special in that the literal meaning of the individuals words do not correspond to the actual meaning of the phrase taken together. As such, this pattern's meaning is a special property inherent to, not any individual word, but the collective. Thus, this meaning has to be listed explicitly.

Appending the suffix "-able" to the end of words to form new adjectives. This is a productive rule as it produces a new set of words from an existing lexicon. For example, if we start with the following three words:

(verb) teach
(noun) comfort
(verb) break

We can generate the following three new adjectives:

(adjective) teachable
(adjective) comfortable
(adjective) breakable

The use of pronouns instead of the original subject (noun phrase) after its first occurrence is a linguistic pattern, motivated by the fact that constantly repeating the noun phrase is cumbersome. As an example the following more awkward sentence:

"Bill ate some cake and then afterwards Bill dyed Bill's hair blue. All Bill's friends told Bill he looked great."

to the following simpler sentence:

"Bill ate some cake and then afterwards he dyed his blue. All his friends told him he looked great."

Tags: PPS, VBN, ABX, AT, JJ, NN, CC, AT, NN

A sentence that only works with DTX rather than ABX is:
"I will either get a hot chocolate or iced tea."
Tags: PPSS, MD, DTX, VBP, AT, NP, CC, NP

A sentence that only works with PP$ rather than PP$$ is:
"It was our favorite ice cream truck."
Tags: PPS, BEDZ, PP$, JJ, NN

A sentence that only works with PP$$ rather than PP$ is:
"That bag of chips was ours."
Tags: DT, NN, BEDZ, PP$$

Consider the tag NN - singular noun (e.g. room). This is a more general form of the following tags:

NNS - plural noun (e.g. rooms)
NN$ - possessive singular noun (e.g. room's windows)
NNS$ - possessive plural noun (e.g. rooms' windows)

All these tags can, for example, fit in this general sentence:

"The room was filthy" (tags: AT, NN, BEDZ, JJ)
"The rooms were filthy" (tags: AT, NNS, BED, JJ)
"The room's windows were filthy" (tags: AT, NN$, BED, JJ)
"The rooms' windows were filthy" (tags: AT, NNS$, BED, JJ)

But, for example, the possessive tags NN$ and NNS$ can be used in ways the non-possessive nouns can't:

"It is the cleaner's problem, not mine" (tags: PPS, BEZ, AT, NN$, PP$$*)
"It is the cleaners' problem, not mine" (tags: PPS, BEZ, AT, NNS$, PP$$*)

Here, the NN (general to all 3 other tags) and NNS (general to NNS$) don't make sense if placed into the sentence:

"It is the cleaner problem, not mine" (NN)
"It is the cleaners problem, not mine" (NNS)

This example is due to the fact that while possessive nouns are nouns, being possessive allows them to be placed in contexts relating to possessive or ownership, in this case of a problem.
