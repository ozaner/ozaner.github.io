## Class 1 & 2
- Use $\&$ instead of $\wedge$ for logical AND
- Use $\text{or}$ instead of $\vee$ for logical AND
- Use $\mathfrak Pa$ for power set of $a$ instead of $\mathcal P(a)$.

He wants us to use the notation in the book but the book doesn't use mathfrak it uses mathcal (or something similar) so... whatever.

## Class 3
A **formula** in set theory is a sentence constructed from **atomic formulas**:

- 'variable $\in$ 'another variable'
- 'variable $=$ 'another variable'

put together using the connectives:

$$ \text{or}, \&, \implies, \iff, \neg, \forall x,\exists x, \text{and } (\,) \text{ for ambiguity.}$$

#### FOL w/o Equality
I asked him a question about having equality defined by extensionality rather than being an atomic predicate. He gave a satisfying answer. He prefers not doing this since having equality allows set theory to fit in with all the other forms of logic which have equality. It also means we don't have to prove things like the substitution rule.

I agree, for practical purposes lets just use FOL with equality. But I also take it as a challenge to develop my set theory without it. OzST will not include extensionality as an axiom and will be founded on a FOL w/o equality.

#### Paradox
Let $c$ be the singleton of the first natural number such that it can be defined with less than 100 symbols. Let $n$ be the unique member of $c$. We just defined that number with less than 100 symbols...

Our language should not be able to make statements like this.

## Class 4
The Algebra of sets, discovered by George Bool, is about the properties of sets and dealign with them with respect to the operators $\cup,\cap,\setminus,\Delta$


Also the teacher uses $-$ for set difference, fair, and $+$ for symmetric difference, what?

## Class 5
Use $<a,b>$ for ordered pairs.
