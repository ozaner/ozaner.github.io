T-symmetry violations justify this notion of a fundamental arrow of time (not just an entropic one), but those few examples of t-symmetry violation are too exotic and inconsequential to explain the entropic asymmetry of time. So then should the question of why there's t-asymmetry be why is there ct-asymmetry? or pt? or why is there CPT-symmetry?

**Standard conception TRI:** keep time positive (same) but reverse order of events AND apply a time-reversal operator (TROP) onto each state:

$$S_0,S_1,S_2,\cdots\implies\cdots,S^\top_2,S^\top_1,S^\top_0$$

**Albert's TRI**: keep time positive (same) but reverse order of events only. This is ok in newtonian mechanics because instantaneous velocity is not intrinsic to an instant but is defined from the sequence of events.

**but..:** reverse time (negate time) and compare the sequence of events, if they are reversed then time symmetric. Negating time makes the physics run in reverse (newtonian velocities get fixed for free) and this works for quantum mechanics too, as in QM is not reversible because of measurement. Reversing the measurement operator doesn't give you back superpositions.

(see what the above idea does for EM. In the end I want a TRI that says EM and Newton are time reversal but not QM because of measurement)

quantum mechanics doesn't have the problem of instantaneous velocities since the entirety of a quantum state is described by the wavefunction which can be expressed either as a position or momentum. Honestly at this point it seems the arrow of time comes from measurement in QM. I can even imagine some ways it deals with entropy.... well maybe not.

newtonian mechanics isn't TRI because of "space invaders" see (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/). Only netownian systems WITHOUT discontinuities are predictable. Norton's dome.

upon further reflection, limiting NM still doesn't help there are too many situations where discontinuties or non differentiable functions could pop up in a reasonable newtonian system.

## thermo + stat
entropy, macrostate is a measruable set and microstates are points in that measurable space. "volume" is jus the measure, the lesbugue measure( i think?) to be exact.

albert generalizes the statistical postulate to all sorts of things. and i buy it. not just macrostates tending towards higher entropy but me keeping my spatula in the drawer and no in the bath since its more likely considering that macrostate.

albert is right, statistical postuilate must be empircal. unless ther is only one possible world that is consistent with the statsictical postulate and newtonian mechaincs...?
