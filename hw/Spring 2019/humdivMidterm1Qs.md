#### Question 1
1. An evolutionary theory is one that posits the biological traits of species of organisms change across generations.
2. Artificial selection is when a non-natural pressure (i.e. a human) selects which traits of a species are valuable by deciding which members of that species will breed based on those traits, thus having those traits being passed down. This concept proves to be a useful jumping point to understanding how natural pressures can also select for certain traits by determining which traits lead to members of a species breeding, thus passing down their traits.
3. For artificial selection to be effective, as we see in the breeding of dogs and crops, the following 3 statements must hold: 1) variation in the species, giving different traits to be valued differently 2) heritability, making it possible for the desired traits to be passed down and 3) selection, in this case done by some agent like a human that values certain traits over others which allows those with these traits to breed and pass them down.
4. Malthus' idea that competition is natural in species because there are not an infinite amount of resources in any environment or, in general earth, and thus only some members of a species will survive to the next generation.
5. Darwin's theory of natural selection depends on the fact that the variation in species effects the 'fitness' or likelihood of breeding and passing traits down, thereby endowing nature with the ability to select traits over time. It 'selects' by introducing certain 'pressures' into the species' environment that are better dealt with by some traits over others.
6. While human breeders provide the mechanism of selection in artificial selection, natural selection does this via the pressures of the environment on species. An example of this might be the combat of predators. A rabbit that has the heritable trait of being faster than other rabbits is better suited to flee predating foxes. This increases its chances of survival and thus of passing down these heritable traits to its offspring. Here the pressure is the predator present in the environment. Another pressure might be a lack of abundant food in the environment. A bird with a beak that is more effective at picking worms form the ground than others is more likely to survive than those who don't and can then pass their traits down.
6. Blending is a problem for Darwin's theory as all the variation in a species would gradually tend towards the mean of their traits. This would leave the species homogenous, leaving no variation for nature to select upon.
