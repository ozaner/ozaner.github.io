Is there anything that distinguishes us from computational systems?

If we are referring to the machine I'm typing on, or any modern computer, then certainly. We are far more complicated in a variety of dimensions compared to any von Neumann architecture. Yet if by computational system we mean to say any Turing machine then certainly not.

It is undeniable that there exists a Turing machine that can *mimic*, we'll put aside the question of phenomenological experience for now, the actions and behaviors of any human that exists and that could possibly exist in the future. Why? Because all our behaviors and actions are products of the physical laws that dictate the mechanics of this universe. While some may doubt that our feelings are purely physical, most people don't require the existence of a dual reality to explain our behaviors and actions. They are, as decades of science have shown us, controlled by our brain and the greater nervous system, and even body, it lies in.

This is important because all physical laws are ultimately described by quantum mechanics and the evolution of these systems can be computed by a Turing machine (even efficiently by a quantum Turing machine).

#### Interactionism
In not writing a paper but to briefly address an objection with my assumption that all our behaviors (not phenomenological feelings) are products of physical laws and thus are computable, let us consider the idea that maybe the dual reality ALSO effects our behavior in the physical world. If this was indeed the case and our behaviors were **not** totally describable by a Turing machine then they would be, by definition, **hyperturing**. If this was the case then we could, in principle, manipulate and embed a human brain into a computer and use it to solve problems **KNOWN** to be unsolvable by contemporary physics in a finite amount of space and time. Even if you are a dualist, I don't think having such a real world (and absurd) consequence tied to your metaphysical theory is desirable.

#### Phenomenological
But if phenomenological awareness is what distinguishes us from computational systems then I can't really speak about it, since it is by its own nature untestable externally. I wouldn't be able to argue that it is a distinguishing characteristic without just asserting it.

The assumption there was that everything is physical which, again, can be countered with: "what if there is magical dual reality where consciousness resides and it was conveniently inaccessible to us via any testable experiment?" To that I'd respond "yeah, what if". -->
