Are we ultimately different than robots in our ethical decision making?

We could be if we made robots whose 'ethical decision making' differed from ours. We could also, necessarily, make robots whose 'ethical decision making' is identical to ours. Indeed, any purely physical process is a computable one. And since any decision making process we undergo, however arbitrary and representative of the greedy algorithm that is evolution, is physical, it too is computable.

Even if that process required such a low level of abstraction as to require a one-to-one simulation of a human brain, such simulations are physically possible (albeit extremely taxing and probably quite a ways off if we get that far).

That's the end of it. Unless there is something supernatural going on inside our bodies that produced some uncomputable answer (a very strong claim indeed), any decision making process that could take place, be it random, a rational evaluation of facts towards some ultimate goal, an arbitrary split second decision, etc. can be implemented in a robot.

If the question is "do current robots have our 'ethical decision making' process", whatever that precisely means, then probably not. We don't have any general purpose AI, only weak task specific ones, so any ethical consideration of them would probably be in their use by humans rather than a capacity built into them.
