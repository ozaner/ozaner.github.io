At what point should we give robots rights, and which rights?

We'll give robots rights, or at least have movements to give robots rights, at the point where the public sees them as deserving of them. When is this? When they can effectively mimic human conversation, emotion, and behaviors. Indeed, humans are not concerned for the rights and freedoms of systems of particles/objects because of some coherent criterion of personhood (a bunk concept in it of itself), but because their evolved and incoherent intuitions tell them too. These intuitions will only 'go off', so to speak, at the sight of *human* features.

This includes their appearances as well. If a robot effectively mimicked human conversation but was just a metal box, it would be harder (yet maybe not impossible) for robot rights groups to feel any need to arise.

Our ideas of rights only arise as a product of our (evolutionarily and culturally) inbuilt intuitions. When AIs and robots can effectively flare up those intuitions, we will feel the need to give them rights. Moreover, we will justify it via some arbitrary criterion of personhood, just like human rights.
